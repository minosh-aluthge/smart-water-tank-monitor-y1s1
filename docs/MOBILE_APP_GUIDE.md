### **iOS (App Store):**
1. **Bluetooth Terminal**
2. **Serial Bluetooth Terminal**

## üîß **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: HC-05 Bluetooth Module Setup**
1. Power on your Arduino with HC-05 module
2. HC-05 should be discoverable (blinking LED)
3. Default settings:
   - **Name**: HC-05 or HC-06
   - **PIN**: 1234 or 0000
   - **Baud Rate**: 9600

### **Step 2: Pair with Mobile Device**
1. Open your phone's Bluetooth settings
2. Search for new devices
3. Select "HC-05" from the list
4. Enter PIN: **1234** (or 0000 if 1234 doesn't work)
5. Wait for "Connected" status

### **Step 3: Install Bluetooth Terminal App**
1. Go to Google Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS)
2. Search for "Serial Bluetooth Terminal"
3. Install the app (usually free)
4. Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted

### **Step 4: Connect App to Arduino**
1. Open the Bluetooth Terminal app
2. Look for "Connect" or "Devices" button
3. Select "HC-05" from paired devices list
4. Connection should show "Connected" status

## üìä **Reading the Data**

### **Real-time Data Display:**
Your mobile app will show live data streams like:

```
pH Value: 7.2
Water conditions OK
Distance: 15.3
Flow Rate: 2.1
Tank is full
No leak detected
```

### **Data Interpretation:**

| **Message** | **Meaning** | **Action Needed** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `pH Value: 7.2` | Water quality is good (6-8 range) | ‚úÖ Normal operation |
| `pH Value: 5.1` | Water too acidic | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check water source |
| `pH Value: 9.3` | Water too alkaline | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check water source |
| `Distance: 5.2` | Water level high | ‚úÖ Tank almost full |
| `Distance: 25.8` | Water level low | üíß Tank needs filling |
| `Tank is full` | Maximum water level reached | ‚úÖ System auto-stopped |
| `Flow Rate: 2.1` | Water flowing at 2.1 L/min | ‚úÖ Normal flow |
| `Leak detected` | System found a leak | üö® **EMERGENCY - Check system** |
| `Water conditions OK` | pH is in safe range | ‚úÖ Safe to use |

## üö® **Alert System**

### **Critical Alerts:**
- **"Leak detected"** - Immediate attention required
- **"Denger leck !"** - Emergency leak state
- **pH outside 6-8 range** - Water quality issue

### **Normal Status:**
- **"Water conditions OK"** - System operating normally
- **"No leak detected"** - All systems safe
- **"Tank is full"** - Automatic operation complete

## üì± **Mobile App Screenshots Guide**

### **Connection Screen:**
1. Open app ‚Üí "Devices" ‚Üí Select "HC-05"
2. Status should show "Connected"

### **Terminal Screen:**
- Real-time data will scroll continuously
- Data updates every 1.5 seconds
- You can scroll up to see previous readings

### **Useful App Features:**
- **Save Log**: Most apps can save readings to file
- **Send Commands**: Some apps allow sending data back to Arduino
- **Timestamps**: Apps usually add time stamps to data
- **Share Data**: Export readings via email/messaging

## üîÑ **Troubleshooting**

### **Cannot Connect to HC-05:**
1. Check Arduino is powered on
2. Verify HC-05 LED is blinking (discoverable mode)
3. Try unpairing and re-pairing Bluetooth
4. Restart the mobile app
5. Check if PIN is 1234 or 0000

### **No Data Showing:**
1. Verify app is connected (not just paired)
2. Check baud rate in app settings (should be 9600)
3. Try different Bluetooth terminal app
4. Restart Arduino system

### **Inconsistent Data:**
1. Check distance between phone and Arduino (max 10 meters)
2. Avoid obstacles between devices
3. Check for interference from other Bluetooth devices

## üìã **Data Logging Tips**

### **For Academic Reports:**
1. Use app's "Save Log" feature
2. Take screenshots of critical readings
3. Document system responses to different conditions
4. Record timestamps for analysis

### **For Demonstrations:**
1. Clear app screen before demo
2. Explain each reading as it appears
3. Show system response to manual tests
4. Demonstrate leak detection feature
